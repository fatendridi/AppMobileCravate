# Android Custom Navigation Drawer Using ExpandableListView

This post is improvements to the previous posts discussed on customization of navigation drawer and highlighting specific row of expandable listview.

Since there are few comments regarding the highlight of expandable list view post, thought to show with new post using custom navigation drawer. But how can we see the highlight of the expandable list view in handset, let’s take navigation drawer and customize it to use expandable list view.

Before starting, I have faced few problems before starting expandablelistview and few questions are shown below. They are?
1.   How and why onchildclicklistener won’t respond but ongroupclicklistener responding?
2.   Whether we can have different background to the group view and child view?
3.   How to highlight the group row or child row on selecting?
4.   How to give the feedback on selection of other row when there is a highlight shown on the other row?
